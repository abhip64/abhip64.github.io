	<p>FurElise is the first video that I had decided to upload to Youtube. This song is really special to me as this was the first major symphony that I had learned to play byheart. FurElise is a really beautiful composition by Beethoven and it is also one of the most popular. People having some interest in listening to piano renditions would have surely come across this song. FurElise is German for "For Elise". It is believed that this music was composed by Beethoven for his love Elise and was suited to her skill level. There are sources which state that their relationship didnt last long and had ended prematurely. Listening to FurElise we do get a sense of their period of relationship. The first half is really pleasant to hear and it might indicate the joyful period in which Beethoven and his lover were together. The second half of the song has a more aggrieved tone indiacting a possible breakup.</p>
	<p>Now coming to the video I have prepared, I do not feel completely satisfied on the quality of performance. The video has only the first part of the song and I hope to finish off the second part some day hopefully. There can be significant improvements in the lighting, sound and other aspects of recording. Nevertheless I uploaded the video just to mark a start to my future performances.</p>
