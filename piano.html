	<p>FurElise is the first video that I had decided to upload to Youtube. This song is really special to me as this was the first major symphony that I had learned to play byheart. FurElise is a really beautiful composition by Beethoven and it is also one of the most popular. People having some interest in listening to piano renditions would have surely come across this song. FurElise is German for "For Elise". It is believed that this music was composed by Beethoven for his love Elise and was suited to her skill level. There are sources which state that their relationship didnt last long and had ended prematurely. Listening to FurElise we do get a sense of their period of relationship. The first half is really pleasant to hear and it might indicate the joyful period in which Beethoven and his lover were together. The second half of the song has a more aggrieved tone indiacting a possible breakup. <a href="https://tonara.com/blog/history-of-fur-elise/">https://tonara.com/blog/history-of-fur-elise/</a> is an interesting read on the topic.</p>
	<p>Now coming to the video I have prepared, I do not feel completely satisfied on the quality of performance. The video has only the first part of the song and I hope to finish off the second part some day hopefully. There can be significant improvements in the lighting, sound and other aspects of recording. Nevertheless I uploaded the video just to mark a start to my future performances.</p>

		When I started out with my channel, I had no plans to make this song. I had decided to make this song after a request from one of my friends. "Manasin Madiyile" is a malayalam song from the movie "Manathe Vellitheru". The video of the song can be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oglFADHecZ4">link</a>. A recent malayalam movie "Vijay Superum Pournamiyum" featured a cover of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Mz71UESb8">song</a> which is also very soothing to hear and have rekindled the attention towards the original song.

	<p>
		The piano transcription of the song has been prepared by me and I believe the rendition has done some justice to the original song.

<p>This video was more of an experiment rather than an actual piano performance. There was very little controbution from my side. I had got the notes of the song from the web. The main objective of this effort was to establish the workflow for creating falling notes piano. I was really fascinated by this format of presentation after seeing videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZUQqtVDmcjm4NY5FkzqLA">Rousseau</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/liltranscriber">LittleTranscriber</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUDTB6EJvzP7eY5Wgl4lRw">Dhruv Gandhi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs7O9sOUQiBGBxaaAguIwig">Patrik Pietschmann</a> etc. I could name many more epic channels but I guess you will get the point after seeing few of their videos.</p>
<p>The prepartion of this video requires 3 types of softwares. The first one being a Digital Music Creation software. I have used GarageBand for this purpose as it came pre-installed with my Macbook. The second one is Synthesia, which takes the MIDI file generated from GarageBand as input and outputs the performance in the falling notes format. The video can be further edited by making use of a video editing software like iMovie or Blender. I will try to write a more detailed guide on getting the output file using this technique in a future post.</p>
<p>Overall I was happy with this new method of music creation which did not require the need for proper lighting or video recording skills. After all, the major thing that matters is that the song should be really enjoyable.</p>

<p> WOW!!!. This was my first reaction after hearing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VR-6AS0-l4">Nuvole Bianche</a>. I immediately knew that this was going to be my next upload. Nuvole Bianche is such a beautiful and soothing composition by the famous Italian pianist and composer Ludovico Maria Enrico Einaudi. The huge number of views that this song has in Youtube is itself a testimony to its popularity.</p>
<p>After several weeks of effort, I was able to play the song appreciably well. I uploaded this video in haste as I was becoming very impatient on not uploading any video for a long time. I do have regrets on the performance being very average. But anyways, this would be one song that I will try to keep in my piano playing arsenal for long. </p>

	<p> The tamil movie "Vaaranam Aayiram" directed by Gautham Vasudev Menon, features this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzLpP8VBC6E">song</a>. The movie alongwith all its beautiful songs leaves such an indellible impact on the audience. The urge to do this song is the sole reason I bought a guitar.</p>
	<p>I strongly believe that no cover can ever give the experience that one feels when seeing the original song. But nevertheless, I did give a try. Some other beautiful covers which inspired me are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AqNsMdAwaA"></a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWFMYYdX4R8"></a>. </p>

<p>The song was made for a friend as a gift for his birthday. It features in the movie "Agent Vinod". The version of the song which I used for the cover is at this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zlt38OOqwDc">link</a>. The song also marks the beginning of a new format of making covers. The objective is to make an exact reproduction of the actual song with the vocals replaced with piano. The entire song is crafted digitally with different instruments with an effort to recreate the actual song.</p>
<p>I have made this song in GarageBand using Steinway Grand Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Electronic Drums, Soft Synth Bells and Epic Cloud Formation. Only the piano is visualised in Synthesia. </p>

	<p>This song too was made as a gift for a friend on his birthday. The version of the song that I used for making the song is at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6k8cpUkKK4c">link</a>. This song which was digitally recreated using GarageBand makes use of Steinway Grand Piano, Acoustic Guitar, Vibraphone, Epic Cloud Formation, Smart Strings and Marimba. I have also been able to make the visualisation of all the instrument notes in Synthesia using the video editor Blender. Overall I was really happy with the way the cover turned out.</p>
