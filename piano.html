	<p>FurElise is the first video that I had decided to upload to Youtube. This song is really special to me as this was the first major symphony that I had learned to play byheart. FurElise is a really beautiful composition by Beethoven and it is also one of the most popular. People having some interest in listening to piano renditions would have surely come across this song. FurElise is German for "For Elise". It is believed that this music was composed by Beethoven for his love Elise and was suited to her skill level. There are sources which state that their relationship didnt last long and had ended prematurely. Listening to FurElise we do get a sense of their period of relationship. The first half is really pleasant to hear and it might indicate the joyful period in which Beethoven and his lover were together. The second half of the song has a more aggrieved tone indiacting a possible breakup. <a href="https://tonara.com/blog/history-of-fur-elise/">https://tonara.com/blog/history-of-fur-elise/</a> is an interesting read on the topic.</p>
	<p>Now coming to the video I have prepared, I do not feel completely satisfied on the quality of performance. The video has only the first part of the song and I hope to finish off the second part some day hopefully. There can be significant improvements in the lighting, sound and other aspects of recording. Nevertheless I uploaded the video just to mark a start to my future performances.</p>

		When I started out with my channel, I had no plans to make this song. I had decided to make this song after a request from one of my friends. "Manasin Madiyile" is a malayalam song from the movie "Manathe Vellitheru". The video of the song can be found in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oglFADHecZ4">link</a>. A recent malayalam movie "Vijay Superum Pournamiyum" featured a cover of this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55Mz71UESb8">song</a> which is also very soothing to hear and have rekindled the attention towards the original song.

		The piano transcription of the song has been prepared by me and I believe the rendition has done some justice to the original song.

<p>This video was more of an experiment rather than an actual piano performance. There was very little controbution from my side. I had got the notes of the song from the web. The main objective of this effort was to establish the workflow for creating falling notes piano. I was really fascinated by this format of presentation after seeing videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPZUQqtVDmcjm4NY5FkzqLA">Rousseau</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/liltranscriber">LittleTranscriber</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUDTB6EJvzP7eY5Wgl4lRw">Dhruv Gandhi</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs7O9sOUQiBGBxaaAguIwig">Patrik Pietschmann</a> etc. I could name many more epic channels but I guess you will get the point after seeing few of their videos.</p>
<p>The prepartion of this video requires 3 types of softwares. The first one being a Digital Music Creation software. I have used GarageBand for this purpose as it came pre-installed with my Macbook. The second one is Synthesia, which takes the MIDI file generated from GarageBand as input and outputs the performance in the falling notes format. The video can be further edited by making use of a video editing software like iMovie or Blender. I will try to write a more detailed guide on getting the output file using this technique in a future post.</p>
<p>Overall I was happy with this new method of music creation which did not require the need for proper lighting or video recording skills. After all, the major thing that matters is that the song should be really enjoyable.</p>
