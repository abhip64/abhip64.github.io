title: About

Hey there! I am Abhijith. I am an aspiring Aerospace Engineer with great keenness to develop robotic systems. I have varied interests and I often find myself putting hands in a multitude of topics such as theoretical physics, psychology, robotics, digital music design etc.  
 I started this blog with the main purpose of serving as a central node for assimilating my thoughts and ideas on the topics that I find interesting. Nothing is more worse than having fleeting memory of the things that you have once devoured with great interest. I find that the key to satisfaction of learning would be when we critically analyse and question what we learn along with documenting our actions and thought processes. I have very little interest in any form of monetising this content with disturbing ads(provided I get any). I am starting this journey for personal satisfaction and would be more than happy if it would be of use to someone else.
