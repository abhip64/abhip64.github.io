"This Will Make You Smarter" is a book compiled by John Brockman. I have not made a mistake by using the word compiled rather than written, as the book is a collection of articles written by profound thinkers from around the globe. These include scientists, journalists, philosophers and professors from various fields.  
John Brockman is the founder of the club called *Edge* which encourages intelluctuals to discuss about varied issues that may or may not be in their field of expertise. Such discussions apparently helps to put the ideas on a wider playing field and thus generating interdisciplinary connections hitherto not thought of. Every year one question is posed to the members of the club, trying to bring out their viewpoints. This book is a result of a question asked in 2011 about "What scientific concept would imrove everybodys cognitive toolkit?". There are a total of 152 answers from eminent intellectuals from across the globe and they all have been neatly compiled in the form of this book. I would try to brief and analyse some of the articles that I liked from this book.
