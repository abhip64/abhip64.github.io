<p>It is not simply that we call the 21st century the age of information. The amount of data available at our fingertips is unfathomably huge. Starting from the morning newspaper, an average person can engage himself by reading books, seeing Youtube videos, surfing through Facebook, Instagram and other social media platforms, watching Television and a myriad of other ways. Even though it is not very evident, in the perspective of information theory all the activities we do exposes our brain to an avalanche of data. But ultimately why do we spend so much of our time trying to acquire data. At the end of each day how much of this can we even recollect. We want to have access to unlimited data but are not ready to take the effort needed to process it.</p>
<p>If you are like me, you might also be trying to find the needle in the haystack. Trying to find that one thing out of all this clutter, that creates an instant spark in your mind. That one piece of information that you decide to enrich and carry forward in your life. That one piece of information creates, what I call a ripple which propagates into the future. Comparing information with a ripple might be a bit misleading. A ripple, even though spreads far and wide, loses its energy and dies down eventually. But something that we love to do gets enriched when we practice it. Even though our command over the topic increases it also gains more strength. The information ripple is perpetually nourished by our efforts.</p>
<p>I would use this blog as a platform to reinforce those topics which I feel have really left a deep impact in me. I will categorize my writings based on broad topics which can be accessed from the sidebar located at the top left corner. I am planning to cover topics which I have found interesting in the field of physics, pyschology, music and robotics. Hope all those who will go through them will enjoy it. I can really benefit a lot from your valuable comments on them.</p>
